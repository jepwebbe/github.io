                        <p>Razputin “Raz” Aquato, trained acrobat and powerful young psychic, has realized his lifelong
                            dream of joining the international psychic espionage organization known as the Psychonauts!
                            But
                            these psychic super spies are in trouble. Their leader hasn't been the same since he was
                            rescued
                            from a kidnapping, and what's worse, there's a mole hiding in headquarters.</p>

                        <p>Combining quirky missions and mysterious conspiracies, Psychonauts 2 is a
                            platform-adventure
                            game with cinematic style and tons of customizable psychic powers. Psychonauts 2 serves up
                            danger, excitement and laughs in equal measure as players guide Raz on a journey through the
                            minds of friends and foes on a quest to defeat a murderous psychic villain.

                        <p>Experience an imaginative, cinematic story that mixes humor and intrigue, brought to you by
                            legendary game designer Tim Schafer (Grim Fandango, Brütal Legend, Broken Age).<br>
                            Explore unique environments using Raz’s ability to dive into people’s brains to battle their
                            inner demons, unlock hidden memories, and resolve their emotional baggage.
                            Leap acrobatically through the air, traversing tightropes and trapezes in a varied,
                            challenging,
                            and joyful platforming experience.
                            Wield a powerful array of psychic powers to blast, burn and levitate things, or even slow
                            down
                            time itself to solve environmental puzzles and battle strange enemies.
